The HTML entry must also contain an inline script. The attack requires a user to click on a malicious URL while running the dev server. Restricted files aren't exposed to the attacker.\n\n### Patches\nFixed in vite@5.0.5, vite@4.5.1, vite@4.4.12\n\n### Details\nSuppose `index.html` contains an inline module script:\n\n```html\n<script type=\"module\">\n  \/\/ Inline script\n<\/script>\n```\n\nThis script is transformed into a proxy script like\n\n```html\n<script type=\"module\" src=\"\/index.html?html-proxy&index=0.js\"><\/script>\n```\n\ndue to Vite's HTML plugin:\n\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/vitejs\/vite\/blob\/7fd7c6cebfcad34ae7021ebee28f97b1f28ef3f3\/packages\/vite\/src\/node\/plugins\/html.ts#L429-L465\n\nWhen `appType: 'spa' | 'mpa'`, Vite serves HTML itself, and `htmlFallbackMiddleware` rewrites `req.url` to the canonical path of `index.html`,\n\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/vitejs\/vite\/blob\/73ef074b80fa7252e0c46a37a2c94ba8cba46504\/packages\/vite\/src\/node\/server\/middlewares\/htmlFallback.ts#L44-L47\n\nso the `url` passed to `server.transformIndexHtml` is `\/index.html`.\n\nHowever, if `appType: 'custom'`, HTML is served manually, and if `server.transformIndexHtml` is called with the unmodified request URL (as the SSR docs suggest), then the path of the transformed `html-proxy` script varies with the request URL. For example, a request with path `\/` produces\n\n```html\n<script type=\"module\" src=\"\/@id\/__x00__\/index.html?html-proxy&index=0.js\"><\/script>\n```\n\nIt is possible to abuse this behavior by crafting a request URL to contain a malicious payload like\n\n```\n\"><\/script><script>alert('boom')<\/script>\n```\n\nso a request to http:\/\/localhost:5173\/?%22%3E%3C\/script%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(%27boom%27)%3C\/script%3E produces HTML output like\n\n```html\n<script type=\"module\" src=\"\/@id\/__x00__\/?\"><\/script><script>alert(\"boom\")<\/script>?html-proxy&index=0.js\"><\/script>\n```\n\nwhich demonstrates XSS.\n\n### PoC\n\n- Example 1. Serving HTML from `vite dev` middleware with `appType: 'custom'`\n    - Go to https:\/\/stackblitz.com\/edit\/vitejs-vite-9xhma4?file=main.js&terminal=dev-html\n    - \"Open in New Tab\"\n    - Edit URL to set query string to `?%22%3E%3C\/script%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(%27boom%27)%3C\/script%3E` and navigate\n    - Witness XSS:\n    - ![image](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/2456381\/287434281-13757894-7a63-4a73-b1e9-d2b024c19d14.png)\n- Example 2. Serving HTML from SSR-style Express server (Vite dev server runs in middleware mode):\n    - Go to https:\/\/stackblitz.com\/edit\/vitejs-vite-9xhma4?file=main.js&terminal=server\n    - (Same steps as above)\n- Example 3. Plain `vite dev` (this shows that vanilla `vite dev` is _not_ vulnerable, provided `htmlFallbackMiddleware` is used)\n    - Go to https:\/\/stackblitz.com\/edit\/vitejs-vite-9xhma4?file=main.js&terminal=dev\n    - (Same steps as above)\n    - You should _not_ see the alert box in this case\n\n### Detailed Impact\n\nThis will probably predominantly affect [development-mode SSR](https:\/\/vitejs.dev\/guide\/ssr#setting-up-the-dev-server), where `vite.transformHtml` is called using the original `req.url`, per the docs:\n\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/vitejs\/vite\/blob\/7fd7c6cebfcad34ae7021ebee28f97b1f28ef3f3\/docs\/guide\/ssr.md?plain=1#L114-L126\n\nHowever, since this vulnerability affects `server.transformIndexHtml`, the scope of impact may be higher to also include other ad-hoc calls to `server.transformIndexHtml` from outside of Vite's own codebase.\n\nMy best guess at bisecting which versions are vulnerable involves the following test script\n\n```js\nimport fs from 'node:fs\/promises';\nimport * as vite from 'vite';\n\nconst html = `\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\" \/>\n  <\/head>\n  <body>\n    <script type=\"module\">\n      \/\/ Inline script\n    <\/script>\n  <\/body>\n<\/html>\n`;\nconst server = await vite.createServer({ appType: 'custom' });\nconst transformed = await server.transformIndexHtml('\/?%22%3E%3C\/script%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(%27boom%27)%3C\/script%3E', html);\nconsole.log(transformed);\nawait server.close();\n```\n\nand using it I was able to narrow down to #13581. If this is correct, then vulnerable Vite versions are 4.4.0-beta.2 and higher (which includes 4.4.0).","notes": "","references": [ {"source": "NPM Advisory reference: ","url": "https:\/\/github.com\/advisories\/GHSA-92r3-m2mg-pj97","name": "https:\/\/github.com\/advisories\/GHSA-92r3-m2mg-pj97"}, {"source": "NPM Advisory reference: ","url": "https:\/\/github.com\/vitejs\/vite\/security\/advisories\/GHSA-92r3-m2mg-pj97","name": "https:\/\/github.com\/vitejs\/vite\/security\/advisories\/GHSA-92r3-m2mg-pj97"}, {"source": "NPM Advisory reference: ","url": "https:\/\/nvd.nist.gov\/vuln\/detail\/CVE-2023-49293","name": "https:\/\/nvd.nist.gov\/vuln\/detail\/CVE-2023-49293"}],"vulnerableSoftware": [ {"software": { "id":"cpe:2.3:a:*:vite:\\>\\=4.4.0\\<4.4.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}}]}]},{"isVirtual": true,"fileName": "xml2js:0.4.23","filePath": "\/builds\/EnterpriseTechnology\/expo-ui\/package-lock.json?xml2js","projectReferences": ["package-lock.json: transitive"],"evidenceCollected": {"vendorEvidence": [{"type": "vendor","confidence": "HIGH","source": "package.json","name": "name","value": "xml2js"}],"productEvidence": [{"type": "product","confidence": "HIGHEST","source": "package.json","name": "name","value": "xml2js"}],"versionEvidence": [{"type": "version","confidence": "HIGHEST","source": "package.json","name": "version","value": "0.4.23"}]},"packages": [{"id": "pkg:npm\/xml2js@0.4.23","confidence": "HIGHEST","url": "https:\/\/ossindex.sonatype.org\/component\/pkg:npm\/xml2js@0.4.23?utm_source=dependency-check&utm_medium=integration&utm_content=8.4.3"}],"vulnerabilities": [ {"source": "OSSINDEX","name": "CVE-2023-0842","severity" : "MEDIUM","cvssv3": {"baseScore": 5.3 ,"attackVector": "N","attackComplexity": "L","privilegesRequired": "N","userInteraction": "N","scope": "U","confidentialityImpact": "N","integrityImpact": "L","availabilityImpact": "N","baseSeverity": "MEDIUM","version": "3.1"},"cwes": ["CWE-1321"],"description": "xml2js version 0.4.23 allows an external attacker to edit or add new properties to an object.
